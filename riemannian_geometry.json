        "term": "Riemannian Metric (g)",
        "explanation": "A choice of an inner product (a smoothly varying positive-definite symmetric bilinear form) gₚ on each tangent space TₚM. This metric allows defining geometric quantities like the length of tangent vectors, angles between them, lengths of curves, areas of surfaces, and volumes."

        "explanation": "A unique rule for differentiating vector fields along curves on (M, g). It generalizes the concept of directional derivative from Euclidean space while being compatible with the metric (lengths and angles are preserved under parallel transport) and torsion-free (symmetric). It defines how tangent vectors change from point to point."

        "term": "Parallel Transport",
        "explanation": "Using the Levi-Civita connection, a tangent vector can be moved along a curve γ such that its covariant derivative along γ is zero. This process, called parallel transport, preserves the vector's length and its angle relative to other parallel transported vectors. It defines 'keeping a vector constant' along a curve in a curved space."

Geodesics are the 'straightest possible lines' in the manifold; locally, they are the shortest paths between points. In flat Euclidean space, they are straight lines."

        "term": "Exponential Map (expₚ)",
        "explanation": "A map from a neighborhood of the origin in the tangent space TₚM to the manifold M. For a tangent vector v ∈ TₚM, expₚ(v) is the point reached by traveling along the unique geodesic starting at p with initial velocity v for time 1. It relates the linear tangent space to the non-linear manifold locally."

            "explanation": "A contraction of the Riemann tensor. Ric(X, X) represents an average of sectional curvatures of planes containing the vector X. It measures the tendency for the volume of small geodesic cones starting in direction X to deviate from the Euclidean case. It plays a crucial role in General Relativity."
